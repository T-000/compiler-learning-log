# Compiler Learning Log

This project documents my structured journey through compiler design: from lexical analysis and parsing to static semantics and type inference.
It combines theoretical understanding with practical insights into how programming languages are translated, analyzed, and verified.

The notes summarize key concepts, algorithms, and personal reflections as I learned how source code is systematically turned into meaning — a process that parallels how modern AI models interpret structured input.

Topics covered:

Lexical Analysis (Regular Expressions, FSMs, Lexer Generators)

Parsing (Context-Free Grammars, LL/LR Parsing, Conflict Resolution)

Static Semantics (Symbol Tables, Type Checking, Hindley–Milner Inference)
